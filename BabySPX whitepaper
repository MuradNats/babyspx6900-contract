🧬 1. Vision — The 10%ER Mission

BabySPX was born as the community-driven successor to SPX6900, a tribute to one of the strongest crypto brands of the new era.
Where SPX6900 symbolizes the giant, BabySPX represents the next generation — a decentralized community proving that collective belief and coordinated action can rewrite market narratives.

Our core mission is simple yet bold:

To reach 10% of SPX6900’s market capitalization through pure community power — “The 10%ER Mission.”

This isn’t about hype — it’s about discipline, transparency, and unity.
Every holder is a builder. Every raid, post, meme, and contribution matters.
We aim to demonstrate that when a community moves with purpose, it becomes unstoppable.

🔥 Burn Strategy

Burns are conducted manually and transparently, driven by community milestones.
Every burn event is announced across official channels (X, Telegram, Medium).
This keeps the token deflationary over time and directly tied to the success of the project.

🧠 3. Utility & Philosophy

Unlike traditional tokens that promise utilities before building trust, BabySPX is built on the community layer first.
Our philosophy:

No false promises — transparency above all

No team wallets — the community is the team

No shortcuts — organic growth only

NFT collections representing the 10%ER movement
